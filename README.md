# Implementation-of-File-Transfer-Protocol-Uisng-Network-Simulation-Tool
The term File transfer protocol refers to a process that involves the transfer of files between devices over a network . Here, We use a simulation tool to know that how does this protocol works and came to know about the problems that can be faced during its working and can be fixed early.
